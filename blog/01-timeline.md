# The AI Timeline: Modeling Asset Value in an Accelerated Future

In the rapidly evolving landscape of 2026 and beyond, traditional valuation models are failing. The key insight driving the **Reasoning Pricer** is simple yet profound: **AI progress affects different asset types differently**.

As Artificial Intelligence accelerates, we observe a financial divergence:
- **Static assets** (like BTC, gold, and fiat-pegged stablecoins) decline in _relative_ value as they cannot adapt.
- **AI-evolving assets** (utility tokens, AI-native protocols) appreciate exponentially as they leverage AI for sustained evolution and efficiency.

## The Timeline Phases

We model this acceleration through three distinct phases, each representing a step-change in AI capability and its economic impact:

| Phase | Timeframe | AI Capability | Market Impact |
|-------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Global Acceleration Accord** | 2026 | AI acceleration frameworks | Initial acceleration impacts; protocol utility begins to rise relative to static assets. |
| **Creative Renaissance** | 2027 | AI as creative partner | Peak acceleration; AI-native assets see massive adoption. |
| **Agentic** | 2028+ | Autonomous AI agents | Full ecosystem integration; autonomous agents become primary economic actors. |

## AI Impact by Asset Type

The model applies multipliers based on how sensitive an asset is to this AI timeline. Below is the projected shift in valuation multipliers from 2025 into the Creative Renaissance of 2027:

| Asset Type | AI Sensitivity | 2025 Multiplier | 2027 Multiplier | Trend |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **AI-Native** | Extreme Positive | 15x | 100x | 🚀 Rapid appreciation |
| **Protocol Utility** | High Positive | 12x | 40x | 📈 Benefits from evolution |
| **Liquid Staking** | Moderate Positive | 10x | 25x | ↗️ Benefits from efficiency |
| **Hard Money** | Low/Negative | 25x | 15x | 📉 Static assets lose relative value |
| **Fiat-Pegged** | Negative | 0.05x | 0.02x | 🔻 Declines faster with AI |

## The Valuation Formula

This timeline is not just theoretical—it is encoded directly into the **Reasoning Pricer** engine. The "Real Multiplier" for any given token is calculated as:

```
Real Multiplier = Base_Multiplier × AI_Timeline_Factor × Risk_Factors
```

By dynamically adjusting the `AI_Timeline_Factor` based on the current acceleration phase and the token's specific **AI Category** (e.g., *Static*, *PassiveUtility*, or *AINative*), the model provides a forward-looking valuation that accounts for the technological singularity.
