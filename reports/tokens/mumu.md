### Analysis
[AI Timeline: Creative Renaissance] Asset classified as Passive Utility (Standard utility tokens with limited AI integration potential. Moderate performance through AI timeline.). AI Timeline Factor: 1.80x (AI acceleration boosts this asset significantly). Meme/Speculative: pure speculation with minimal fundamental value (0.05x floor - collector value) (base range: 0.05x - 0.50x). Class A (Real Yield) receives 1.2x risk class boost - resilient during market stress. Insider control (30/100) reduces multiplier by 0.85x due to centralization risks. Rank #350 imposes 0.2x penalty (illiquid, capital flight crushes value). Liquidity friction (Market Cap: $3.0e5) adds a 25% baseline tariff. Final real valuation multiplier: 0.09x. Token trading at $1.00 today would be worth $0.09 post-fiat collapse (loss of purchasing power). AI acceleration provides strong tailwinds. Trading signal (SELL): Overvalued or high risk post-collapse. Reduce exposure.
