### Analysis
[AI Timeline: Creative Renaissance] Asset classified as Static (Cannot Evolve) (Static assets that cannot adapt to AI acceleration. These assets decline in value as AI progresses.). AI Timeline Factor: 0.20x (AI acceleration penalizes this static asset). Hard Money (Store of Value): becomes the new reserve currency (base range: 20x - 50x). Class A (Real Yield) receives 1.2x risk class boost - resilient during market stress. Insider control (10/100) reduces multiplier by 0.95x due to centralization risks. Rank #12 applies 0.8x adjustment (mid-tier liquidity). Final real valuation multiplier: 6.4x. Token trading at $1.00 today would be worth $6.38 post-fiat collapse. AI acceleration creates headwinds for this asset class. Trading signal (HOLD): Moderate value post-collapse. Maintain current position.
