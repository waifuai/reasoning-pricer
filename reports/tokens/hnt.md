[AI Timeline: Creative Renaissance] Asset classified as Passive Utility (Standard utility tokens with limited AI integration potential. Moderate performance through AI timeline.). AI Timeline Factor: 1.80x (AI acceleration boosts this asset significantly). Protocol Utility Token: benefits from network effects and protocol utility (base range: 10x - 25x). Class A (Real Yield) receives 1.2x risk class boost - resilient during market stress. Insider control (40/100) reduces multiplier by 0.80x due to centralization risks. Rank #50 applies 0.8x adjustment (mid-tier liquidity). Final real valuation multiplier: 24.2x. Token trading at $1.00 today would be worth $24.19 post-fiat collapse. AI acceleration provides strong tailwinds. Trading signal (BUY): Undervalued post-collapse. Accumulate before systemic shift.
