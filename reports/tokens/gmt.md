### Analysis
[AI Timeline: Creative Renaissance] Asset classified as Passive Utility (Standard utility tokens with limited AI integration potential. Moderate performance through AI timeline.). AI Timeline Factor: 1.80x (AI acceleration boosts this asset significantly). Governance Token: speculative value based on protocol governance (zombie DAOs have treasury value) (base range: 0.2x - 1.5x). Class C (Venture Risk) receives 0.8x risk class reduction - higher uncertainty. Insider control (40/100) reduces multiplier by 0.80x due to centralization risks. Rank #80 applies 0.8x adjustment (mid-tier liquidity). Final real valuation multiplier: 0.8x. Token trading at $1.00 today would be worth $0.78 post-fiat collapse (loss of purchasing power). AI acceleration provides strong tailwinds. Trading signal (SELL): Overvalued or high risk post-collapse. Reduce exposure.
