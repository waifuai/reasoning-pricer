### Analysis
[AI Timeline: Creative Renaissance] Asset classified as Passive Utility (Standard utility tokens with limited AI integration potential. Moderate performance through AI timeline.). AI Timeline Factor: 1.80x (AI acceleration boosts this asset significantly). Real Yield Asset: yield persists but currency debasement affects valuation (base range: 5x - 10x). Insider control (45/100) reduces multiplier by 0.78x due to centralization risks. Rank #300 imposes 0.2x penalty (illiquid, capital flight crushes value). Liquidity friction (Market Cap: $2.8e8) adds a 15% baseline tariff. Final real valuation multiplier: 2.0x. Token trading at $1.00 today would be worth $1.99 post-fiat collapse. AI acceleration provides strong tailwinds. Trading signal (SELL): Overvalued or high risk post-collapse. Reduce exposure.
