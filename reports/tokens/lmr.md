### Analysis
[AI Timeline: Creative Renaissance] Asset classified as AI-Enabled (Assets that can integrate AI capabilities. Strong growth as AI adoption increases.). AI Timeline Factor: 4.44x (AI acceleration boosts this asset significantly). Protocol Utility Token: benefits from network effects and protocol utility (base range: 10x - 25x). Class A (Real Yield) receives 1.2x risk class boost - resilient during market stress. Insider control (20/100) reduces multiplier by 0.90x due to centralization risks. Rank #350 imposes 0.2x penalty (illiquid, capital flight crushes value). Liquidity friction (Market Cap: $5.6e5) adds a 25% baseline tariff. Final real valuation multiplier: 15.1x. Token trading at $1.00 today would be worth $15.10 post-fiat collapse. AI acceleration provides strong tailwinds. Trading signal (BUY): Undervalued post-collapse. Accumulate before systemic shift.
