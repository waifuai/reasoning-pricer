### Analysis
[AI Timeline: Creative Renaissance] Asset classified as AI-Native (Built specifically for AI ecosystems. Maximum AI acceleration benefits.). AI Timeline Factor: 8.33x (AI acceleration boosts this asset significantly). Protocol Utility Token: benefits from network effects and protocol utility (base range: 10x - 25x). Class A (Real Yield) receives 1.2x risk class boost - resilient during market stress. Insider control (60/100) reduces multiplier by 0.70x due to centralization risks. Rank #400 imposes 0.2x penalty (illiquid, capital flight crushes value). Final real valuation multiplier: 24.5x. Token trading at $1.00 today would be worth $24.50 post-fiat collapse. AI acceleration provides strong tailwinds. Trading signal (BUY): Undervalued post-collapse. Accumulate before systemic shift.
