### Analysis
[AI Timeline: Creative Renaissance] Asset classified as AI-Native (Built specifically for AI ecosystems. Maximum AI acceleration benefits.). AI Timeline Factor: 8.33x (AI acceleration boosts this asset significantly). Meme/Speculative: pure speculation with minimal fundamental value (0.05x floor - collector value) (base range: 0.05x - 0.50x). Class A (Real Yield) receives 1.2x risk class boost - resilient during market stress. Insider control (25/100) reduces multiplier by 0.88x due to centralization risks. Rank #150 imposes 0.2x penalty (illiquid, capital flight crushes value). Liquidity friction (Market Cap: $3.9e7) adds a 20% baseline tariff. Final real valuation multiplier: 0.4x. Token trading at $1.00 today would be worth $0.43 post-fiat collapse (loss of purchasing power). AI acceleration provides strong tailwinds. Trading signal (SELL): Overvalued or high risk post-collapse. Reduce exposure.
