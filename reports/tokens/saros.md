### Analysis
[AI Timeline: Creative Renaissance] Asset classified as Passive Utility (Standard utility tokens with limited AI integration potential. Moderate performance through AI timeline.). AI Timeline Factor: 1.80x (AI acceleration boosts this asset significantly). Protocol Utility Token: benefits from network effects and protocol utility (base range: 10x - 25x). Class A (Real Yield) receives 1.2x risk class boost - resilient during market stress. Insider control (55/100) reduces multiplier by 0.72x due to centralization risks. Rank #500 imposes 0.2x penalty (illiquid, capital flight crushes value). Liquidity friction (Market Cap: $6.7e6) adds a 25% baseline tariff. Final real valuation multiplier: 4.9x. Token trading at $1.00 today would be worth $4.93 post-fiat collapse. AI acceleration provides strong tailwinds. Trading signal (HOLD): Moderate value post-collapse. Maintain current position.
