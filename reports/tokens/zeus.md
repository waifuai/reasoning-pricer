### Analysis
[AI Timeline: Creative Renaissance] Asset classified as Static (Cannot Evolve) (Static assets that cannot adapt to AI acceleration. These assets decline in value as AI progresses.). AI Timeline Factor: 0.20x (AI acceleration penalizes this static asset). Protocol Utility Token: benefits from network effects and protocol utility (base range: 10x - 25x). Class A (Real Yield) receives 1.2x risk class boost - resilient during market stress. Insider control (25/100) reduces multiplier by 0.88x due to centralization risks. Rank #300 imposes 0.2x penalty (illiquid, capital flight crushes value). Final real valuation multiplier: 0.7x. Token trading at $1.00 today would be worth $0.74 post-fiat collapse (loss of purchasing power). AI acceleration creates headwinds for this asset class. Trading signal (SELL): Overvalued or high risk post-collapse. Reduce exposure.
